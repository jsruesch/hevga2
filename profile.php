          Constance Steinkuehler is an Associate Professor in Digital Media at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Co-Director of the Games+Learning+Society (GLS) center at the Wisconsin Institute of Discovery, and Chair of their annual GLS Conference. In 2011-2012, she served as Senior Policy Analyst in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) where she advised on national initiatives related to games. Policy work there included the coordination of cross-agency efforts to leverage games toward national priority areas (e.g. childhood obesity, early literacy, STEM education) and the creation of new partnerships to support an ecosystem for more diversified innovation in commercial and non-commercial games. She currently serves as President of the Learning Games Network (LGN), a non-for-profit organization that partners and amplifies R&D at universities across the nation working on games for impact.

          Constance's research is on cognition and learning in commercial entertainment games and games designed for impact. Current interests include neuroscience and games (particularly in the areas of attention and emotional and social well-being), learning analytics (informal scientific reasoning, problem-solving, so called “non-cognitive” skills such as interest and persistence), and the development of mixed methodologies for online discourse analysis. Her work has been funded by the MacArthur Foundation, the National Academy of Education/ Spencer Foundation, the Gates Foundation, and the National Science Foundation. She has published over twenty peer reviews publications on games and learning, three edited books three special issues of peer reviewed academic journals focused on the intellectual life of games, and the 2009 National Academies of Science report entitled Learning Science: Computer Games, Simulations, and Education. Game titles include Tenacity and Crystals of Kaydor.
